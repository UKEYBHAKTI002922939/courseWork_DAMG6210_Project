# courseWork_DAMG6210_Project (002922939)


This project aims to create a Database to understand the various Health Insurance Policy plans available with different Health Insurance Companies in the United States. The main object is to enable the customer to find the best and most affordable Health Insurance plan that suits their needs.

The motivation behind choosing this project is my lack of knowledge regarding the Health Insurance system in the United States. I want to device a platform that can answer important questions regarding Health Insurance Systems and give an opportunity to the consumer to make an informed choice.
